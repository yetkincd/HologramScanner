# HologramScanner

The HologramScanner is a system that aims to make the process of scanning small objects for 3D display with autostereoscopic systems more convenient. The system which is ideal for usage with microscopes and for holographic video creation typically requires a microscope, webcam, arduino and Stepper Motor. The advantages of the system include the fact that it is ideal for viewing small objects and gives images an illusion of depth.

Below is a graph describing how the system which utilizes "Rotational Scanning" works:

In summary the system requires that a camera be carefully positined in front of a microscope under which a stepper motor with an object that is to be scanned is placed. The camera then takes 48 photos as the stepper motor rotates. After which the photos are sent to the PC and combined into a quilt for display using a Looking Glass or similar autostereoscopic device.

Another variant of the HologramScanner uses linear scanning to take images of life sized objects.
