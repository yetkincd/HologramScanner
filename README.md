# HologramScanner

The HologramScanner is a system that aims to make the process of scanning small objects for 3D display with autostereoscopic systems more convenient. The system which is ideal for usage with microscopes and for holographic video creation typically requires a microscope, webcam, arduino and Stepper Motor. The advantages of the system include the fact that it is ideal for viewing small objects and gives images an illusion of depth.

Below is a graph describing how the system which utilizes "Rotational Scanning" works:
